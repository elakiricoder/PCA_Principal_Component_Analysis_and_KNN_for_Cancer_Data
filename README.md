# PCA - Principal Component Analysis and KNN for Breast Cancer Dataset
<br/>
<br/>
This is PCA - Principal Component Analysis for Breast Cancer Dataset and then Performing KNN using the PCA data performed with Python.
<br/>
<br/>
The breast cabcer dataset can be directly loaded from sklearn. The reason why I'm picking the simple cancer data is that it has many features. 
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that PCA is not a full machine learning algorithm. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm which only reduces the dimensions and then you can use a machine learning algorithm to classify the data.

 **Steps:**

 - [x] 1 - Imports <br />
 - [x] 2 - Load the Data <br />
 - [x] 3 - Standardize the data <br />
 - [x] 4 - Transform Data with PCA <br />
 - [x] 5 - Visualize the PCA transformed Data <br />
 - [x] 6 - Split the PCA transformed Data<br />
 - [x] 7 - Apply the PCA data to KNN <br />
 - [x] 8 - Evalute the Model <br />
 - [x] 9 - Check the error rate at different K values <br />
 - [x] 10 - Identify the lowest error rate and modify the model <br />
 - [x] 11 - Test a sample <br />
